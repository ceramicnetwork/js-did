# Concepts overview

Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) are a suite of tools and APIs to interact with and manage [Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)](https://w3c.github.io/did-core/).

## DIDs

[DIDs](https://w3c.github.io/did-core/#dfn-decentralized-identifiers) are unique persistent identifiers that do not require a centralized registration authority and are often generated and/or registered cryptographically. 

## DID Sessions

DID Sessions are cryptographically created and verifiable, serializable objects that store information about which DIDs authenticated them, what capabilities they are authorized with and for how long.
