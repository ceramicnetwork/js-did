# PKH DID method resolver

This package contains did:pkh method resolver implementation. Please refer to the [specification](https://github.com/spruceid/ssi/blob/main/did-pkh/did-pkh-method-draft.md) for details about how this DID method works.

## Usage
This package is used as a plugin to the [`did-resolver`](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/did-resolver) library, which is the primary interface for resolving DIDs.

See the [ceramic developer site](https://developers.ceramic.network/) for more details about how to use this package.

### Installation
```
$ npm install pkh-did-resolver
```

### Resolving a PKH DID

```js
import { Resolver } from 'did-resolver'
import { getResolver } from 'pkh-did-resolver'

const pkhResolver = getResolver()
const resolver = new Resolver(pkhResolver)

const didResolutionResult = await resolver.resolve('did:pkh:eip155:1:0xab16a96d359ec26a11e2c2b3d8f8b8942d5bfcdb')
```

Result:
```js
{
  "didDocument": {
    "assertionMethod": [
      "did:pkh:eip155:1:0xab16a96d359ec26a11e2c2b3d8f8b8942d5bfcdb#blockchainAccountId",
